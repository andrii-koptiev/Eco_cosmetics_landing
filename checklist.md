## Checklist for preparing a portfolio project for HR review
1. Don’t forget to add a title for the whole web page (it could be the name of your landing)
2. A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma
3. Links in the header and footer menus should lead to the corresponding blocks of the landing page
4. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
5. Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the phone number
6. Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
7. Add favicon
8. Add a smooth scroll for the whole page
9. The user must have the opportunity to write 2-3 lines of text in the message field
10. It would be more realistic if the "shopping cart" button was active and clickable
11. Buttons “shop”, “to contact us”, “all products” must be with hover styles
12. All items in the shop section must have hover effects
13. All “learn more” buttons should also have hover styles
14. All the social icons in the footer should be clickable and open the social networks in a new tab
15. The phone number and mail in the footer must be clickable and when clicked, the browser must offer to call the specified number or write a letter to the specified mail.
16. The form shouldn’t accept incorrect data in a field with a phone number (for example, a number with a letter and there was no error), give this and all inputs a correct input type
17. The form shouldn’t submit empty
18. The "contact us" form should be automatically reset after submit and don’t show 404/405 errors after sending
